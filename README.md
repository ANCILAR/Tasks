# Tasks Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a set of backend and frontend coding tasks. Each task file includes a difficulty rating represented with stars.

## Project Structure

- `BackendTasks/`: Backend-focused tasks
- `FrontendTasks/`: Frontend-focused tasks

## Rating Convention

At the end of each task file, you'll find a heading indicating its difficulty:

```
## Rating: ⭐⭐⭐
```

The number of stars reflects the relative complexity (more stars = more challenging).
