# Tiny URL — Frontend Task

## Summary

Build a simple frontend app to shorten URLs, list created short links, and perform actions (copy, open, delete). Keep code clean, reusable, and delivery-ready.

## Goals

* Show practical frontend skills: component design, state management, types (preferably TypeScript).
* Deliver a working, responsive UI with basic accessibility.

## Core Requirements

* Form to enter a long URL and receive a short URL.
* URL validation and user-friendly errors.
* List of created short links with actions: Copy, Open, Delete.
* Persist data client-side.

## Stretch (optional)

* Custom alias, QR code, click count (stubbed), JSON import/export, tests.

## Candidate Skills Evaluation

1. **TypeScript vs JavaScript** — TypeScript preferred; JavaScript acceptable. Look for types, and clear interfaces.
2. **Styling** — Add styles if time permits. Tailwind preferred; plain CSS acceptable. Look for responsiveness and accessible contrast.
3. **State Management** — Use **Redux** preferred; Zustand acceptable. Keep global vs local state separation clear.
4. **Reusability** — Prioritize small, composable components and reusable hooks.

## Evaluation (brief)

* Functionality, code quality/types, state architecture, reusability, styling/UX, docs/tests.
